## [Diciottesimo](http://jspkay.altervista.org/18esimo/index.html)

Back when I was a kid (I was just turning 18 years old), I wanted to invite my friends in pure nerd style üòé
To do so, I made some nice brochoures to invite them and, to have everybody covered, I also made this website. Feel free to take a look. It's in Italian though...
In italy, 18 is the age of majority. And I was still living in Sicily. So no English-speaking friends ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
BTW, "diciottesimo" literally means "eighteenth" (from "diciotto", 18). It's the Italian way of talking about the eighteenth birthday.

## [Laurea](https://laureasalvo.altervista.org)

In a similar fashion, when I graduated for my master, I made a little website to invite my friends. The idea actually started by the need to have a "party favor", which is a little gift Italians use to give to the guest of some event (like a graduation or a marriage). My idea was: "let's make a little game for the guests to enjoy!" And so I did. You can find them in the dedicated section.
