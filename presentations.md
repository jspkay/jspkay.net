# Presentations

## [PhD Days 24](/presentations/phdays24)

In Ecole Centrale de Lyon (my PhD alma mater) there is a nice event, held every year: PhD Days. It's a nice moment for all the PhD students to share their research with peers and professors of other specialties in a funny and digestable way. I am particularly proud of this presentation, it took quite a while... Raw html, css and js. I made it using the amazing impress.js !

## [Fairphone for French Class](/presentations/french_fairphone/main.html)

Since I am an Italian student in a French school, I need to learn French! Our French teacher asked us to make a little presentation about some sustainable company which operate in France. French people are particularly caring of the environment (as you know, first world problems...) and mine was about Fairphone. Made with marp.
