# Introduction

Today I was speaking with my friends. 
We were arguing about the origin of life, one of those existential question that is as old as human consciousness. 
As you may or may not know, we can roughly estimate that 50% of the population believes in creation and about 50% of the population believes in any science alternative theory (the most accepted being the big bang)[^1].

Both theories are valuable as it is impossible (at least scientifically, since we could otherwise have faith) to prove one or the other theory. 
As a scientist, I can only make conjectures and opine them.

Although there are many [theories of Creationism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creationism), no one is really sure of what happened, but we can only speculate looking at the current proofs that we have.

Nevertheless an interesting question was raised: my friends argued that ancient technology is just lost to time, but those people must have had a hell of a technology to pull off impressive monuments as the pyramids. 

Talking about the topic I found out about hints of [aeronautics in ancient India](https://www.sanskritimagazine.com/concept-aeronautics-ancient-india/)
[another similar link](https://ancient-archaeology.com/2023/04/what-powered-the-vimanas-indias-6000-year-old-flying-machines/)

Now, let's imagine for a moment that ancient humans actually managed to build such machines, then there would be two main questions:
- how did they do it? 
- why we could not find any evidence of them? 

The answer to the first question is more uncertain, but here a couple of theories:
- they were actually smart, but did not write much stuff about it or some catastrophic event obliterated the 
- aliens came here and gave humans technology (or implanted humans on the planet)

The second is a bit more interesting:
- I would argue that, if such a technology existed, it might have been "green" and so it got destroyed by time. And here we could compute the probability of any proof reaching us, depending on the technology.
