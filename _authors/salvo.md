Although my official name is Salvatore Pappalardo, everybody calls me Salvo.
I currently am a PhD student in Ecole Centrale de Lyon, busy working on hardware reliability for AI. 
I recently discovered the beauty of learning for the sake of learning.
You should know that I come from Sicily and there culture is somewhat a seldom topic, for some reason.

In any case, I hope you enjoy the content in this website!
Have fun ! :)
